<p>I use ProtonMail for when I actually need to email a human (rarely), and I&#39;ve moved across to iCloud for day-to-day account management, with a pinch of Maildrop thrown in for those terrible throwaway moments.</p>

<h2>You&#39;ve got mail</h2><!-- If you've read the other sections you know that I've kept a hold of Gmail for now as an archive. Plus, I used it as the login for all my accounts so I'm slowly migrating over to my iCloud email which I've never used.

I'm guessing Apple will become a problem at some point but I'm happy with them having my data right now. Whereas Facebook and Google are amassing my data to hyper-target me with ads, Apple is likely using it to better sell me their hardware and software that I'm already bought in to. I'm cool with that for now. -->
<p>I use a combination of the following email:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://icloud.com">iCloud Mail</a> for account logins, mailing list subscriptions, etc</li>
<li><a href="https://protonmail.com">ProtonMail</a> for when I actually need to email a human, which is rare these days considering the other methods of communication we have. ProtonMail is super secure, which you can use with a custom domain if you want or it has a free account with decent enough limits to help encourage you to declutter your mail.</li>
<li><a href="https://maildrop.cc">Maildrop</a> for when I need a 100% disposable email address. All email addresses are public so you don&#39;t want to use this for anything important or secure. I typically use it when registering for &quot;free&quot; WiFi access in coffee shops and on the train. If it&#39;s free, why do you want my data?? I&#39;d have to use the WiFi for months to get what I consider to be the equivalent value for my data.</li>
</ul>
<p>Free should mean free. Your data is worth more than that.</p><hr/>
