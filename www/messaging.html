<p>I still use WhatsApp despite my opinion of Facebook. This is mostly because my wife uses it and it&#39;s our primary method of communicating [when we&#39;re not in the same room. Though sometimes still in the same house.]</p>

<h2>End-to-end encryption is the &quot;feature&quot; you&#39;re looking for</h2><p><a href="https://www.whatsapp.com/">WhatsApp</a> has end-to-end encryption which gets a big thumbs up üëç. This means that the content of your messages can only be seen by you‚Äîthe sender‚Äîand the person(s) you send it to. The content can&#39;t be seen by WhatsApp. However, they can see all the metadata such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Where you use the app</li>
<li>When you use the app</li>
<li>Who you send messages to</li>
<li>What time you send messages</li>
<li>The amount of messages</li>
<li>The type of message (text, image, video, GIF)</li>
<li>Etc, etc</li>
</ul>
<p>And, because it&#39;s WhatsApp and they&#39;re part of the Facebook Group, guess who they share their data with. That&#39;s right.</p>
<p>Try these alternatives:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://signal.org">Signal</a> is meant to be the most secure.</li>
<li><a href="https://wire.com/en/">Wire</a> is also meant to be super secure and looks to be more aimed at the work environment.</li>
<li><a href="https://telegram.org">Telegram</a> uses end-to-end encryption but apparently it&#39;s their own special brand and has flaws.
