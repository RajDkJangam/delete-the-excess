<p>I deleted my Google data [except Gmail] and paused all future tracking. I no longer use Chrome and have no Google apps installed on any of my devices. This includes native Google Doc apps, Google Drive, etc. I also, no longer use any email client to automatically pull new email from Gmail. If I need to access to anything Google related, I do it through a browser I can trust.</p>

<h2>Don&#39;t forget about Google</h2><p>With all the negative news Facebook has been getting it was easy to be ignorant about Google. I knew Google tracked me and used that data to advertise to me. I knew that. That&#39;s why I&#39;d changed browsers and started using a different search engine. But for some I never thought of that data collection in the same scary light as I did with Facebook. Until I came across a <a href="https://twitter.com/iamdylancurran/status/977560174117474304">thread on Twitter</a>. I won&#39;t repeat the content of that here, I&#39;ll just go through the steps you should take to check out your data and stop Google tracking you.</p>

<h2>Steps to detox your Google data <a href="#guide">#guide</a></h2><ol>
<li><p>First things first: download your data <a href="https://takeout.google.com">https://takeout.google.com</a></p>
</li>
<li><p>Google has created a decent data dashboard for you to drill down into <a href="https://myaccount.google.com/dashboard">https://myaccount.google.com/dashboard</a>.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>I used this to delete the excess data Google had that I wasn&#39;t getting any value from anymore. I deleted all my contacts, photos, groups, calendars, etc. I wasn&#39;t using any of these anymore and wouldn&#39;t be again.</p>
</li>
<li><p>I deleted my Google+ profile. I didn&#39;t know I had one.</p>
</li>
<li><p>I deleted Google Analytics tracking from some old websites. Apparently, Google Analytics tracks 25% of the internet. These days I use browsers that block these trackers so why would I impose tracker upon other people. Deleted.</p>
</li>
<li><p>I moved all of my files off Google Drive. Make sure you delete the Trash too!</p>
</li>
<li><p>I kept Gmail, purely for archival purposes. I went in a cleaned out a lot of old emails and folders I no longer need or use. I&#39;ve used Gmail email as a login for a few things so it&#39;s worth keeping for me.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p>View your Google activity <a href="https://myactivity.google.com/myactivity">https://myactivity.google.com/myactivity</a>. There is a lot!</p>
</li>
<li><p>Delete your Google activity <a href="https://myactivity.google.com/delete-activity">https://myactivity.google.com/delete-activity</a></p>
<ol>
<li><p>If you want: Change <strong>Today</strong> to <strong>All time</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Check what products you have selected. I selected <strong>All products</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Click <strong>Delete</strong>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p>Change your Google activity tracking for the future <a href="https://myaccount.google.com/activitycontrols">https://myaccount.google.com/activitycontrols</a></p>
<ol>
<li><p>You&#39;ll probably find these are all enabled by default to better help hyper-target adverts to you.</p>
</li>
<li><p>I went ahead and toggled all these to disabled (paused) and unchecked any relevant boxes. You might want to do the same.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p>Take a look at even more Google activity options <a href="https://myactivity.google.com/more-activity">https://myactivity.google.com/more-activity</a> because why wouldn&#39;t they all be together?</p>
<ol>
<li>This includes your Location History timeline. You might think this is kinda cool or scary. You could go ahead a delete all that through the settings cog ‚öôÔ∏è</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p>Check you&#39;re happy with everything by doing a Privacy Checkup <a href="https://myaccount.google.com/privacycheckup">https://myaccount.google.com/privacycheckup</a></p>
</li>
<li><p>You might as well do a Security Checkup since you&#39;re here <a href="https://myaccount.google.com/security-checkup">https://myaccount.google.com/security-checkup</a></p>
</li>
<li><p>If you&#39;re feeling super brave you could Delete your Google Account completely <a href="https://myaccount.google.com/deleteaccount">https://myaccount.google.com/deleteaccount</a></p>
</li>
<li><p>You&#39;re done. Have a hug ü§ó</p>
