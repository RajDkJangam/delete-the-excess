<p>I use a combination of Brave and Firefox Focus.</p>

<h2>Do not track</h2><p>You can go to extremes in this area with Virtual Private Networks which I may get into in the future but I&#39;m not there now. For the average person I use a combination of two browsers:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://brave.com">Brave</a></strong> is a great browser that blocks trackers. These are things that the big data hoarders use to find out more about you. Stopping them gives them less of your data but check this out: it also makes loading websites faster because these horrible tracker things take time to download. Stopping trackers is awesome!</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/focus">Firefox Focus</a></strong> on my mobile is brilliant. It too has all the tracker stopping magic but what I really like is there are no tabs. One of my problems was tab clutter. I used to just keep things open for no reason because I thought I might come back to it. Firefox Focus has helped me kill that habit. If that specific tab truly is important, you&#39;ll remember it later.</li>
</ul>
<p>I also switched my default search engine to <strong>DuckDuckGo</strong> on these browsers. DuckDuckGo doesn&#39;t store any data and you soon get used to the fact that it&#39;s not Google.</p>
<p>That&#39;s it. No more Chrome. No more Safari. No more tracking.</p><hr/>
