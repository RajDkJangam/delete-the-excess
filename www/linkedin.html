<p>I download my LinkedIn data and discovered I suddenly had the email addresses of everyone I was connected to. I didn&#39;t know this privacy permission was enabled by default. Did you? I deleted my LinkedIn account.</p>

<h2>Dark patterns</h2><p>After Facebook, LinkedIn was next on my list of things that was wasting my time and wasn&#39;t giving me any value in return.</p>
<p>Using the same tactics as Facebook; LinkedIn uses every conceivable means to notify you of ‚Äúnew activity‚Äù on your account in an attempt to pull you back in. One of the darkest patterns LinkedIn uses is attempting to trick you into sharing itself with all of your contacts <strong>every single time you sign in</strong> to spread their data-gathering abilities.</p>
<p>Once I&#39;d successfully dismissed these barriers to access, the interactions I had on LinkedIn were with people I often didn&#39;t know trying to ‚Äúconnect‚Äù with me, or recruiters sending me messages about irrelevant jobs.</p>
<p>LinkedIn is another one of these companies that hide a ton of privacy permissions in your settings that are all enabled by default. You need to know where to look to switch everything off but when they change the product so frequently, how are you supposed to keep up?</p>
<p>If you&#39;re a recruiter or someone looking for work then maybe stick with it. If you are neither of those I don&#39;t think it holds enough value as a platform for meaningful interactions.</p>
<p>A couple of times I tried sharing some posts in the same way I do on Twitter but they didn&#39;t get the same traction and didn&#39;t start the same interesting conversations. Maybe I was doing it wrong but in the end it was another noisy channel that was just that: noise. It was time to delete.</p>
<p>If you ever find yourself in a position where you are looking for work you can setup a new account. You could easily have over a hundred connections in a day if you really wanted.</p>

<h2>Steps to delete LinkedIn <a href="#guide">#guide</a></h2><ol>
<li><p>First things first: access and download your account data <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/50191/accessing-your-account-data?lang=en">https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/50191/accessing-your-account-data?lang=en</a></p>
</li>
<li><p>From the <strong>Privacy</strong> tab under <strong>Settings &amp; Privacy</strong> you will see loads of options related to privacy permissions. Each one is enabled by default. You might want to go through and disabled them all.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If you&#39;re ready: you could close your account; permanently deleting your profile and removing access to all your LinkedIn information <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/63/closing-your-linkedin-account?lang=en">https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/63/closing-your-linkedin-account?lang=en</a>. There is some baiting to try and get you to stay but don&#39;t fall for it. You&#39;ve got your data downloaded. You can think of more creative ways to make use of those endorsements and recommendations.</p>
</li>
<li><p>You&#39;re done. Have a hug ü§ó</p>
