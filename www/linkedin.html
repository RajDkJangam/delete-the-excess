<p>I download my LinkedIn data and discovered I suddenly had the email addresses of everyone I was connected to. I didn&#39;t know that privacy permission was enabled by default. Did you? I deleted my LinkedIn account.</p>

<p>After Facebook, LinkedIn was next on my list of things that were wasting my time and weren&#39;t giving me any value in return.</p>
<p>All the interactions I ever had were with people I often didn&#39;t know, trying to &quot;connect&quot; with me or recruiters sending me messages about irrelevant jobs. There was also a tremendous amount of phishing for job related information.</p>
<p>LinkedIn is also another one of these companies that hide a ton of privacy permissions all enabled by default. You need to dig into your settings to switch everything off but when they change the product so frequently, how are you supposed to keep up?</p>
<p>If you&#39;re a recruiter or someone looking for work then maybe stick with it. If you are neither of those I don&#39;t think it holds enough value.</p>
<p>A couple of times I tried sharing some posts in the same way I do on Twitter but they didn&#39;t get the same traction and didn&#39;t start the same interesting conversations. Maybe I was doing it wrong, but in the end it was another noisy channel that was just that: noise. It was time to delete.</p>
<p>If you ever find yourself in a position where you are looking for work, just set a new account up. You could have over a hundred connections in a day if you really wanted.</p>

<h2>Steps to delete LinkedIn <a href="#guide">#</a></h2><ol>
<li><p>First things first: access and download your account data <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/50191/accessing-your-account-data?lang=en">https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/50191/accessing-your-account-data?lang=en</a></p>
</li>
<li><p>From the <strong>Privacy</strong> tab under <strong>Settings &amp; Privacy</strong> you will see load of options related to privacy permissions. Each one is all enabled by default. You might want to go through and disabled them all.)</p>
</li>
<li><p>If you&#39;re ready: you could close your account; permanently deleting your profile and removing access to all your LinkedIn information <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/63/closing-your-linkedin-account?lang=en">https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/63/closing-your-linkedin-account?lang=en</a>. There is some baiting to try and get you to stay, but don&#39;t fall for it. You&#39;ve got your data downloaded. You can think of more creative ways to make use of those endorsements and recommendations</p>
</li>
<li><p>You&#39;re done. Have a hug ðŸ¤—</p>
