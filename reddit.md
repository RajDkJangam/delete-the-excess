## How to delete your account

So â€”Â I don't hold my Reddit data so close to my heart so I'm not too concerned with losing my posts. Let me know if you are and I'll dig into how to download data.

1. Deleting your account won't delete your posts. If you want to do this you'll have to do in manually. Go to **Your profile** and click **Delete** on every post.

2. Go to [https://www.reddit.com/prefs/deactivate/](https://www.reddit.com/prefs/deactivate/)

3. Fill out the form and click **Deactivate account**

4. You're done. Have a hug ðŸ¤—
