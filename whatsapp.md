## Note: We cannot delete your account for you at this time

OK. This is a strange one. To delete your WhatsApp account seems straight forward:

1. Open WhatsApp

2. Go to **Settings > Account > Delete My Account**.

3. Enter your full phone number and tap **Delete My Account**.

That's it. This should be the point where you get a hug â€” but. WhatsApp have a strange message on their support pages that says *Note: We cannot delete your account for you at this time* ðŸ¤”

Why can't that *actually* delete your account? This is odd. I'm trying to find out more. Will update soon.
