## How to download your data?

**We don't know.**

We're looking into this as there doesn't appear to be an easy first-party way to download your data (photos). There are third-party apps that say they can do it, but you shouldn't have to authorise another app — potentially handing over more data to yet another company — to download your data.

We don't want to detail how to delete your account until we know more. Will update soon.
