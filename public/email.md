# Private email

<!-- > I use ProtonMail for when I actually need to email a human (rarely), and I've moved across to iCloud for day-to-day account management, with a pinch of Maildrop thrown in for those terrible throwaway moments. -->

## You've got mail

<!-- If you've read the other sections you know that I've kept a hold of Gmail for now as an archive. Plus, I used it as the login for all my accounts so I'm slowly migrating over to my iCloud email which I've never used.

I'm guessing Apple will become a problem at some point but I'm happy with them having my data right now. Whereas Facebook and Google are amassing my data to hyper-target me with ads, Apple is likely using it to better sell me their hardware and software that I'm already bought in to. I'm cool with that for now. -->

You could use one email for everything or you could use a combination of different email services for different purposes.

Try these alternatives:

- [iCloud Mail](http://icloud.com) for account logins, mailing list subscriptions, etc
- [ProtonMail](https://protonmail.com) for when you actually need to email a human. ProtonMail is super secure, which you can use with a custom domain if you want or it has a free account with decent *enough* limits to help encourage you to declutter your mail.
- [Maildrop](https://maildrop.cc) for when you need a 100% disposable email address. All email addresses are public so you don't want to use this for anything important or secure. This comes in handy when registering for “free” WiFi access in coffee shops and on the train. Remember: free means free. Exchanging your data for Wifi is not free.
