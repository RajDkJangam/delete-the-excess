# Delete the excess

**A series of advice and guides for the privacy conscious and the minimalists; trying to reduce their digital data footprint, become anonymous, and make time.**

Privacy is becoming a bigger and bigger concern. These days you don't have to look very far to find negative news on the likes of Facebook or Google; two tech giants collecting the most extensive data set ever assembled on human social behaviour for the sole purpose of advertising to us.

People are becoming more conscious of their privacy, who they share data with and what permissions they give to companies. I am one of those people.

Recently, I have become increasingly aware of how much of me and my data is online. It feels like every few months there is news of a new data breach where I pause and think, *‘They have my personal data and credit card details’*.

I considered: how many products I'd signed up to, how many companies I'd handed personal data to, how many permissions I'd granted, how many privacy policies I hadn't read. I was no longer ignorant to this social norm. It was time to reduce my digital footprint and take back control of *my* data.

On top of this, I had become a slave to all these digital products that were supposed to be making my life: easier, simpler, more convenient. But—the reality—they were taking more of my time away than ever before, providing frictionless distractions and meaningless interactions at my fingertips 24/7/365.

Apparently, the average mobile phone user checks their device 150 time a day. We've become addicted. It's not our fault. These companies have designed their products to be addictive. They want us to keep checking our notifications and using their products so they can amass more data they can sell, to show us hyper-targeted advertisements, to take more of our time and our money.

It's time to start taking back.

I set myself challenges: to reduce my data footprint, to become more distraction-free, to make time for things that truly matter, to minimise the clutter in my life both physically and digitally.

These days I ask myself: does this add value to my life? If not, I have to let it go.

I want other people to start considering the same question. Justify it to yourself, no-one else. Be aware of who you share your data with and what permissions you're handing over. What are you getting in return? Do the products you use serve a purpose?

Start creating a more minimal digital you. Keep the value. Delete the excess.
