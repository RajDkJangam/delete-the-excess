# Delete Google

> I deleted my Google data [except Gmail] and paused all future tracking. I no longer use Chrome and have no Google apps installed on any of my devices. This includes native Google Doc apps, Google Drive, etc. I also, no longer use any email client to automatically pull new email from Gmail. If I need to access to anything Google related, I do it through a browser I can trust.

With all the negative news Facebook has been getting it was easy to be ignorant about Google. I knew Google tracked me and used that data to advertise to me. I knew that. That's why I'd changed browsers and started using a different search engine. But for some I never thought of that data collection in the same scary light as I did with Facebook. Until I came across a [thread on Twitter](https://twitter.com/iamdylancurran/status/977560174117474304). I won't repeat the content of that here, I'll just go through the steps you should take to check out your data and stop Google tracking you.

##¬†See for yourself what data Google has [#](#guide)

1. First things first: download your data [https://takeout.google.com](https://takeout.google.com)

2. Google has created a decent data dashboard for you to drill down into [https://myaccount.google.com/dashboard](https://myaccount.google.com/dashboard).

  2.1. I used this to delete the excess data Google had that I wasn't getting any value from anymore. I deleted all my contacts, photos, groups, calendars, etc. I wasn't using any of these anymore and wouldn't be again.

  2.2. I deleted my Google+ profile. I didn't know I had one.

  2.3. I deleted Google Analytics tracking from some old websites. Apparently, Google Analytics tracks 25% of the internet. These days I use browsers that block these trackers so why would I impose tracker upon other people. Deleted.

  2.4. I moved all of my files off Google Drive. Make sure you delete the Trash too!

  2.5. I kept Gmail, purely for archival purposes. I went in a cleaned out a lot of old emails and folders I no longer need or use. I've used Gmail email as a login for a few things so it's worth keeping for me.

3. View your Google activity [https://myactivity.google.com/myactivity](https://myactivity.google.com/myactivity). There is a lot!

4. Delete your Google activity [https://myactivity.google.com/delete-activity](https://myactivity.google.com/delete-activity)

  4.1. If you want: Change **Today** to **All time**.

  4.2 Check what products you have selected. I selected **All products**.

  4.3 Click **Delete**.

5. Change your Google activity tracking for the future [https://myaccount.google.com/activitycontrols](https://myaccount.google.com/activitycontrols)

  5.1. You'll probably find these are all enabled by default to better help hyper-target adverts to you.

  5.2. I went ahead and toggled all these to disabled (paused) and unchecked any relevant boxes. You might want to do the same.

6. Take a look at even more Google activity options [https://myactivity.google.com/more-activity](https://myactivity.google.com/more-activity) because why wouldn't they all be together?

  6.1. This includes your Location History timeline. You might think this is kinda cool or scary. You could go ahead a delete all that through the settings cog ‚öôÔ∏è

7. Check you're happy with everything by doing a Privacy Checkup [https://myaccount.google.com/privacycheckup](https://myaccount.google.com/privacycheckup)

8. You might as well do a Security Checkup since you're here [https://myaccount.google.com/security-checkup](https://myaccount.google.com/security-checkup)

9. If you're feeling super brave you could Delete your Google Account completely [https://myaccount.google.com/deleteaccount](https://myaccount.google.com/deleteaccount)

10. You're done. Have a hug ü§ó
