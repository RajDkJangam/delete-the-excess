## How to download your data

*I don't know.* I'm looking into this as there doesn't appear to be an easy first-party way to download your data (photos). I've come across third-party apps that say they can do it, but should we really have to authorise another app — potentially handing over a ton of data to yet another company — to download our data.

I'm trying to find out more and don't want to detail how to delete your account until I do. Will update soon.
