# Encrypted messaging

> I still use WhatsApp despite my opinion of Facebook. This is mostly because my wife uses it and it's our primary method of communicating [when we're not in the same room. Though sometimes still in the same house.]

## End-to-end encryption is the "feature" you're looking for

[WhatsApp](https://www.whatsapp.com/) has end-to-end encryption which gets a big thumbs up. This means that the content of your messages can only be seen my you—the sender—and the person(s) you send it to. The content can't be seen my WhatsApp. However, the can see all the metadata that surrounds that such as:

- Where you use the app
- When you use the app
- Who you send messages to
- What time you send messages
- The amount of messages
- The type of message (text, image, video, GIF)

And, because it's WhatsApp and they're part of the Facebook Group, guess who they share their data with.

Try these alternatives:
 - [Signal](https://signal.org) is meant to be the most secure.
 - [Wire](https://wire.com/en/) is also meant to be super secure and looks to be more aimed to the work environment.
 - [Telegram](https://telegram.org) uses end-to-end encryption but apparently it's their own special brand and has flaws.
